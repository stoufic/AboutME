# AboutME# 👋 Hi, I’m Toufic Saleh  

I’m a **Computer Science senior at Virginia Tech** with a passion for building **real-world solutions through software, AI, and cloud architecture**. My journey spans from creating lightweight web extensions that help students save hours, to developing **full-stack applications, CI/CD pipelines, forecasting dashboards, and scalable cloud systems**.  

Alongside my personal work, I also **lead a small team of up to 5 developers/designers** on client projects. I handle **end-to-end coordination** — from requirements gathering to delivery — ensuring projects are shipped efficiently, professionally, and at scale.

## 💻 What I Do  
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building RESTful APIs, interactive front-ends, and database-driven apps.  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Designing deployment architectures, automating with CI/CD, and working hands-on with AWS (EC2, RDS/Postgres, IAM, Lambda).  
- **Data & Forecasting**: Developing load forecasting pipelines for energy markets (PJM, ERCOT, CAISO) using Python, PostgreSQL, and visualization dashboards.  
- **AI/Automation**: Integrating AI to streamline workflows — from **resume-tailoring job bots** (EZ-Apply) to **AI-driven tutoring platforms** (Qalaam Pro).  
- **Team Leadership**: Managing cross-functional teams of up to 5, delegating tasks, and driving client-focused delivery.
